Publish your work on a custom domain, invite your audience to subscribe, send them new content by email newsletter, and offer premium subscriptions to generate sustainable recurring revenue to fund your work. </p><p>Ghost is an independent, open source app, which means you can customize absolutely everything. Inside the admin area, you&apos;ll find straightforward controls for changing themes, colors, navigation, logos and settings &#x2014; so you can set your site up just how you like it. No technical knowledge required.</p><p>If you&apos;re feeling a little more adventurous, there&apos;s really no limit to what&apos;s possible. With just a little bit of HTML and CSS you can modify or build your very own theme from scratch, or connect to Zapier to explore advanced integrations. Advanced developers can go even further and build entirely custom workflows using the Ghost API.</p><p>This level of customization means that Ghost grows with you. It&apos;s easy to get started, but there&apos;s always another level of what&apos;s possible. So, you won&apos;t find yourself outgrowing the app in a few months time and wishing you&apos;d chosen something more powerful!</p><hr><p>For now, you&apos;re probably just wondering what to do first. To help get you going as quickly as possible, we&apos;ve populated your site with starter content (like this post!) covering all the key concepts and features of the product.</p><p>You&apos;ll find an outline of all the different topics below, with links to each section so you can explore the parts that interest you most.</p><p>Once you&apos;re ready to begin publishing and want to clear out these starter posts, you can delete the &quot;Ghost&quot; staff user. Deleting an author will automatically remove all of their posts, leaving you with a clean blank canvas.</p><h2 id="your-guide-to-ghost">Your guide to Ghost</h2><ul><li><a href="amplitudesolutions.com.br/design/">Customizing your brand and site settings</a></li><li><a href="amplitudesolutions.com.br/write/">Writing &amp; managing content, an advanced guide for creators</a></li><li><a href="amplitudesolutions.com.br/portal/">Building your audience with subscriber signups</a></li><li><a href="amplitudesolutions.com.br/sell/">Selling premium memberships with recurring revenue</a></li><li><a href="amplitudesolutions.com.br/grow/">How to grow your business around an audience</a></li><li><a href="amplitudesolutions.com.br/integrations/">Setting up custom integrations and apps</a></li></ul><p>If you get through all those and you&apos;re hungry for more, you can find an extensive library of content for creators over on <a href="https://ghost.org/blog/">the Ghost blog</a>.</p><hr><h2 id="getting-help">Getting help</h2><p>If you need help, <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/">Ghost(Pro)</a> customers can always reach our full-time support team by clicking on the <em>Ghost(Pro)</em> link inside their admin panel.</p><p>If you&apos;re a developer working with the codebase in a self-managed install, check out our <a href="https://forum.ghost.org">developer community forum</a> to chat with other users.</p><p>Have fun!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide]]></title><description><![CDATA[A full overview of all the features built into the Ghost editor, including powerful workflow automations to speed up your creative process.]]></description><link>amplitudesolutions.com.br/write/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6207d18b08ace1531fd3fbc2</guid><category><![CDATA[Soluções]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ghost]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 15:26:07 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/writing-posts-with-ghost.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/writing-posts-with-ghost.png" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"><p>Ghost comes with a best-in-class editor which does its very best to get out of the way, and let you focus on your content. Don&apos;t let its minimal looks fool you, though, beneath the surface lies a powerful editing toolset designed to accommodate the extensive needs of modern creators.</p><p>For many, the base canvas of the Ghost editor will feel familiar. You can start writing as you would expect, highlight content to access the toolbar you would expect, and generally use all of the keyboard shortcuts you would expect.</p><p>Our main focus in building the Ghost editor is to try and make as many things that you hope/expect might work: actually work. </p><ul><li>You can copy and paste raw content from web pages, and Ghost will do its best to correctly preserve the formatting. </li><li>Pasting an image from your clipboard will upload inline.</li><li>Pasting a social media URL will automatically create an embed.</li><li>Highlight a word in the editor and paste a URL from your clipboard on top: Ghost will turn it into a link.</li><li>You can also paste (or write!) Markdown and Ghost will usually be able to auto-convert it into fully editable, formatted content.</li></ul><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/editor.png" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="3182" height="1500"><figcaption>The Ghost editor. Also available in dark-mode, for late night writing sessions.</figcaption></figure><p>The goal, as much as possible, is for things to work so that you don&apos;t have to <em>think</em> so much about the editor. You won&apos;t find any disastrous &quot;block builders&quot; here, where you have to open 6 submenus and choose from 18 different but identical alignment options. That&apos;s not what Ghost is about.</p><p>What you will find though, is dynamic cards which allow you to embed rich media into your posts and create beautifully laid out stories.</p><h2 id="using-cards">Using cards</h2><p>You can insert dynamic cards inside post content using the <code>+</code> button, which appears on new lines, or by typing <code>/</code> on a new line to trigger the card menu. Many of the choices are simple and intuitive, like bookmark cards, which allow you to create rich links with embedded structured data:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-bookmark-card"><a class="kg-bookmark-container" href="https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/"><div class="kg-bookmark-content"><div class="kg-bookmark-title">Open Subscription Platforms</div><div class="kg-bookmark-description">A shared movement for independent subscription data.</div><div class="kg-bookmark-metadata"><img class="kg-bookmark-icon" src="https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/images/favicon.png" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"><span class="kg-bookmark-author">Open Subscription Platforms</span></div></div><div class="kg-bookmark-thumbnail"><img src="https://opensubscriptionplatforms.com/images/osp-card.png" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div></a></figure><p>or embed cards which make it easy to insert content you want to share with your audience, from external services:</p><figure class="kg-card kg-embed-card"><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hmH3XMlms8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></figure><p>But, dig a little deeper, and you&apos;ll also find more advanced cards, like one that only shows up in email newsletters (great for personalized introductions) and a comprehensive set of specialized cards for different types of images and galleries.</p><blockquote>Once you &#xA0;start mixing text and image cards creatively, the whole narrative of the story changes. Suddenly, you&apos;re working in a new format.</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-full"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/andreas-selter-xSMqGH7gi6o-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="6000" height="4000"></figure><p>As it turns out, sometimes pictures and a thousand words go together really well. Telling people a great story often has much more impact if they can feel, even for a moment, as though they were right there with you.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/andreas-selter-e4yK8QQlZa0-unsplash.jpg" width="4572" height="3048" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/steve-carter-Ixp4YhCKZkI-unsplash.jpg" width="4032" height="2268" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div></div></div></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/lukasz-szmigiel-jFCViYFYcus-unsplash.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="2560" height="1705"></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-gallery-card kg-width-wide kg-card-hascaption"><div class="kg-gallery-container"><div class="kg-gallery-row"><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/jd-mason-hPiEFq6-Eto-unsplash.jpg" width="5184" height="3888" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div><div class="kg-gallery-image"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/jp-valery-OBpOP9GVH9U-unsplash.jpg" width="5472" height="3648" loading="lazy" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide"></div></div></div><figcaption>Peaceful places</figcaption></figure><p>Galleries and image cards can be combined in so many different ways &#x2014; the only limit is your imagination.</p><h2 id="build-workflows-with-snippets">Build workflows with snippets</h2><p>One of the most powerful features of the Ghost editor is the ability to create and re-use content snippets. If you&apos;ve ever used an email client with a concept of <em>saved replies</em> then this will be immediately intuitive.</p><p>To create a snippet, select a piece of content in the editor that you&apos;d like to re-use in future, then click on the snippet icon in the toolbar. Give your snippet a name, and you&apos;re all done. Now your snippet will be available from within the card menu, or you can search for it directly using the <code>/</code> command.</p><p>This works really well for saving images you might want to use often, like a company logo or team photo, links to resources you find yourself often linking to, or introductions and passages that you want to remember.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/createsnippet.png" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="2282" height="1272"></figure><p>You can even build entire post templates or outlines to create a quick, re-usable workflow for publishing over time. Or build custom design elements for your post with an HTML card, and use a snippet to insert it.</p><p>Once you get a few useful snippets set up, it&apos;s difficult to go back to the old way of diving through media libraries and trawling for that one thing you know you used somewhere that one time.</p><hr><h2 id="publishing-and-newsletters-the-easy-way">Publishing and newsletters the easy way</h2><p>When you&apos;re ready to publish, Ghost makes it as simple as possible to deliver your new post to all your existing members. Just hit the <em>Preview</em> link and you&apos;ll get a chance to see what your content looks like on Web, Mobile, Email and Social.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-width-wide"><img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/preview.png" class="kg-image" alt="Writing and managing content in Ghost, an advanced guide" loading="lazy" width="3166" height="2224"></figure><p>You can send yourself a test newsletter to make sure everything looks good in your email client, and then hit the <em>Publish</em> button to decide who to deliver it to.</p><p>Ghost comes with a streamlined, optimized email newsletter template that has settings built-in for you to customize the colors and typography. We&apos;ve spent countless hours refining the template to make sure it works great across all email clients, and performs well for email deliverability.</p><p>So, you don&apos;t need to fight the awful process of building a custom email template from scratch. It&apos;s all done already!</p><hr><p>The Ghost editor is powerful enough to do whatever you want it to do. With a little exploration, you&apos;ll be up and running in no time.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[How to grow your business around an audience]]></title><description><![CDATA[A guide to collaborating with other staff users to publish, and some resources to help you with the next steps of growing your business]]></description><link>amplitudesolutions.com.br/grow/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6207d18b08ace1531fd3fbbc</guid><category><![CDATA[Soluções]]></category><category><![CDATA[Recursos]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ghost]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 15:26:04 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/admin-settings.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/admin-settings.png" alt="How to grow your business around an audience"><p>As you grow, you&apos;ll probably want to start inviting team members and collaborators to your site. Ghost has a number of different user roles for your team:</p><p><strong>Contributors</strong><br>This is the base user level in Ghost. Contributors can create and edit their own draft posts, but they are unable to edit drafts of others or publish posts. Contributors are <strong>untrusted</strong> users with the most basic access to your publication.</p><p><strong>Authors</strong><br>Authors are the 2nd user level in Ghost. Authors can write, edit and publish their own posts. Authors are <strong>trusted</strong> users. If you don&apos;t trust users to be allowed to publish their own posts, they should be set as Contributors.</p><p><strong>Editors</strong><br>Editors are the 3rd user level in Ghost. Editors can do everything that an Author can do, but they can also edit and publish the posts of others - as well as their own. Editors can also invite new Contributors &amp; Authors to the site.</p><p><strong>Administrators</strong><br>The top user level in Ghost is Administrator. Again, administrators can do everything that Authors and Editors can do, but they can also edit all site settings and data, not just content. Additionally, administrators have full access to invite, manage or remove any other user of the site.<br><br><strong>The Owner</strong><br>There is only ever one owner of a Ghost site. The owner is a special user which has all the same permissions as an Administrator, but with two exceptions: The Owner can never be deleted. And in some circumstances the owner will have access to additional special settings if applicable. For example: billing details, if using <a href="https://ghost.org/pricing/"><strong>Ghost(Pro)</strong></a>.</p><blockquote><em>Ask all of your users to fill out their user profiles, including bio and social links. These will populate rich structured data for posts and generally create more opportunities for themes to fully populate their design.</em></blockquote><hr><p>If you&apos;re looking for insights, tips and reference materials to expand your content business, here&apos;s 5 top resources to get you started:</p><ul><li><a href="https://ghost.org/blog/how-to-create-a-newsletter/"><strong>How to create a premium newsletter (+ some case studies)</strong></a><strong> </strong> <br>Learn how others run successful paid email newsletter products</li><li><strong><a href="https://ghost.org/blog/membership-sites/">The ultimate guide to membership websites for creators</a></strong><br>Tips to help you build, launch and grow your new membership business</li><li><strong><a href="https://newsletterguide.org/">The Newsletter Guide</a></strong><br>A 201 guide for taking your newsletters to the next level</li><li><a href="https://ghost.org/blog/find-your-niche-creator-economy/"><strong>The proven way to find your niche, explained</strong></a><br>Find the overlap and find a monetizable niche that gets noticed</li><li><strong><a href="https://ghost.org/blog/newsletter-referral-programs/">Should you launch a referral program? </a></strong><br>Strategies for building a sustainable referral growth machine</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Configurando apps e extensões]]></title><description><![CDATA[Work with all your favorite apps and tools or create your own custom integrations using the Ghost API.]]></description><link>amplitudesolutions.com.br/integrations/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">6207d18b08ace1531fd3fbba</guid><category><![CDATA[Soluções]]></category><dc:creator><![CDATA[Ghost]]></dc:creator><pubDate>Sat, 12 Feb 2022 15:26:03 GMT</pubDate><media:content url="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/app-integrations.png" medium="image"/><content:encoded><![CDATA[<img src="https://static.ghost.org/v4.0.0/images/app-integrations.png" alt="Configurando apps e extens&#xF5;es"><p>It&apos;s possible to extend your Ghost site and connect it with hundreds of the most popular apps and tools using integrations. </p><p>Whether you need to automatically publish new posts on social media, connect your favorite analytics tool, sync your community or embed forms into your content &#x2014; our <a href="https://ghost.org/integrations/">integrations library</a> has got it all covered with hundreds of integration tutorials.</p><p>Many integrations are as simple as inserting an embed by pasting a link, or copying a snippet of code directly from an app and pasting it into Ghost.
